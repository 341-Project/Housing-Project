# Housing-Project
Hello, 

https://housingproject.azurewebsites.net/
*our sql database constitutes thousands of pieces of data, and if you are unable and need access to it please contact us.

Please take a look at our link above.

To get our project up and running, we made it easy for you!

Click the link above and it will direct you to our site.

Creating an account is not necessary to operate the main function, which is search.

There are 90 properties in our database, some counties have more than others. Some counties have none at all.

This database theoretically should grow as time progresses.

The income put in by the user will dictate what program they fall into, which is dictated by state requirements, also stored in our database. 

By selecting counties, you direct the search to display where specifically you would like to find a home, and display ones you qualify for. 

All code was codereviewed by our team, on Matt Heider's computer, thus all pushes were done by his account. This in no way should negatively reflect the contributions by the other members of this team.
